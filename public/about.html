<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an aspiring web developer, and I created this site as a portfolio that I intend on scaling as I learn new
  technologies. I was most recently employed for almost 10 years as a local law enforcement officer. Before that,
  I worked in several other jobs; ranging from food service in my high school years, to technical support for various
  companies. During my various careers I have learned many things and had varying experiences. During my time in law
  enforcement, for example, I developed a unique insight into how people from all socioeconomic backgrounds interact
  and think. I also became proficient in a wide range of technology used in my day to day duties. This has changed my
  life outlook as a whole, giving me a well-rounded skill set.

  Although the majority of my career experience has been in law enforcement, I have always had a love and affinity towards
  technology. Over the years I have built computers, learned new operating systems (including Linux), and dabbled in 
  programming in various languages. I possess an associate's degree in general studies, and I immediately began working on 
  a bachelor's degree in information systems. I initially intended on studying web development, but due to my college being 
  located in a major military cyber hub, I started to move towards cybersecurity. Sadly, due to family and other factors I had 
  to postpone my studies. It was at this time that I began my law enforcement career, prompted by my sense of service in my 
  relatively small town.

  I created this website as part of the Udemy course "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp", taught by Angela Yu of "The App Brewery". 
  My hope is that this bootcamp will give me the working knowledge to begin a new career in full stack web development.
